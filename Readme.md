# Bingo Board
A dynamic bingo board for the UA ACM meetings. Currently just a template of a bingo board.

There are some goals for this project
* Make different boards for each user
* Allow for easy customization of the bingo card for a given meeting
* Allow an unlimited number of square options to increase the variation of cards


Optional
* Running 100% serverless in AWS (and likely for free)
