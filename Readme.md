# Bingo Board
A dynamic bingo board for the UA ACM meetings. Currently just a template of a bingo board.

There are some goals for this project
* [ ] Make different boards for each user
* [ ] Allow for easy customization of the bingo card for a given meeting
* [ ] Allow an unlimited number of square options to increase the variation of cards


Optional
* [x] Running 100% serverless in AWS 
* [x] Running for free


This project uses the serverless framework to enable versioning of the infrastructure and for simple portability.
For more on the serverless framework, checkout their [website](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/). 
This project can be modified to run as a go server on a bare metal machine as well, though the project is focused on serverless.
